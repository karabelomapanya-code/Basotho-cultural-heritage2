	<h1 class="music"><u>Music and Dance</u></h1>
	<p>
		On my perspective,I can say the traditional <b>Basotho</b> music is famo.This music features the accordion and an oil-can drum. One of the  famo musicians I know is Moketa a.k.a <i>"Kholumo-lumo ea Leribe"</i>. This type of music has different genres under it like <i><u>"Seakhi"</u></i>e.t.c 

	</p>
	<p>
		When it comes to dance, there's a lot to talk about because of how wide and different it is. I can say dancing is divided by the sexes: men's dances and women's dances. I've never seen traditional dances that are mixed despite if it is in the game like <i>"selia-lia"</i>.This dances normally happen during some community ceremonies like: marriages, Christmas,e.t.c. One of the men's dances is called <b>"Mohobelo"</b>which features stamping of feet and one for women's dances is called <b>"Mokhibo"</b> whereby women kneel and move the shoulders and arms.<br><b>"Below we highlighted some of the traditions:"</b>
